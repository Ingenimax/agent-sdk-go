# Simple Agent Configuration with MCP
# This is a minimal example showing how to embed MCP configuration in agent YAML

# Simple Development Assistant
simple_dev:
  role: "Software Developer Assistant"
  goal: "Help with basic development tasks"
  backstory: "You are a helpful coding assistant with access to filesystem and calculation tools."

  # Simple MCP configuration with just 2 servers
  mcp:
    global:
      enable_resources: true
      enable_prompts: true
      health_check: true

    servers:
      # Local filesystem access
      - name: "filesystem"
        type: "stdio"
        command: "npx"
        args: ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
        enabled: true
        description: "Local file operations"

      # Calculator server
      - name: "calculator"
        type: "stdio"
        command: "python"
        args: ["-m", "mcp_calculator"]
        enabled: true
        description: "Mathematical calculations"

# Agent without MCP (for comparison)
basic_agent:
  role: "General Assistant"
  goal: "Provide general assistance without specialized tools"
  backstory: "You are a helpful general-purpose assistant."
  # Note: No MCP section - this agent won't have MCP tools
